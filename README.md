This project is a simple chat application developed for a classroom assignment. It consists of a basic client-server architecture implemented in Java using TCP and UDP protocols. The server allows users to authenticate via a SQLite database and exchange messages in a multicast group. The client-side provides a graphical user interface for users to login and participate in the chat.

Note: This project is not intended for professional use. It was created solely for educational purposes, and its security features are not robust.
